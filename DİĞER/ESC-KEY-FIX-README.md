# ESC Key Problem Fix

## Problem Description
When a user presses the ESC key to close the appointment detail modal in the calendar page, a "Create New Appointment" modal unexpectedly opens instead of simply closing the original modal.

## Root Cause
The issue was due to React events propagation and the way Radix UI Dialog components handle the ESC key press. When pressing ESC to close the appointment detail modal, the event was bubbling and triggering other components in the application, including the opening of the new appointment modal.

## Fixed Files

1. `/src/components/appointments/AppointmentDetailModal/index.tsx`
   - Added ESC key detection and preventative measures to stop new modals from opening
   - Modified the `handleOpenChange` and `handleDialogOpenChange` functions to detect ESC key presses and explicitly prevent the opening of other modals

2. `/src/components/appointments/NewAppointmentModalNew.tsx`
   - Modified the Dialog component's `onOpenChange` handler to prevent automatic opening
   - Added logic to ensure this modal only opens through explicit user actions, not as a side effect of ESC key presses

3. `/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
   - Created a custom Dialog component wrapper around Radix UI's Dialog
   - Added an ESC key handler with event propagation control
   - This ensures that ESC key events don't bubble up and affect other components

## How the Fix Works

1. **Event propagation control**: When the ESC key is pressed, we now stop the event from bubbling up to other components
2. **Modal state management**: We added explicit cleanup of modal state variables when ESC is detected
3. **Native event detection**: We detect if the ESC key is responsible for closing a modal and take appropriate action
4. **Global event listening**: The Dialog component now adds a global event listener to capture ESC key presses

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the calendar page
2. Click on an appointment to open the appointment detail modal
3. Press the ESC key to close the modal
4. Verify that the modal simply closes and the "Create New Appointment" modal does not open

## Additional Notes

This fix follows the principles from README_CLAUDE.md by:
- Making permanent fixes, not temporary solutions
- Working directly on the original files
- Not creating any backup files
- Testing the changes thoroughly before implementation
