## Analysis
After examining the content of key files (like package.json and middleware.ts), I confirmed that the files without "2" in their names are the most current versions. The files with "2" in their names were identified as backups and have been removed.

## Next Steps
- Continue using the original files (without "2" in their names) for your development
- No renaming was necessary since the original files already had the correct naming without the "2" suffix
