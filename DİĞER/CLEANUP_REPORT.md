# Backup Files Cleanup Report

## Overview
All backup files with "2" in their names have been identified and deleted from the root directory of the project.

## Analysis
After examining the content of key files like `package.json`, `middleware.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`, I determined that:

- The files WITHOUT "2" in their names are the current/main versions
- The files WITH "2" in their names are outdated backups

For example:
- `package.json` (current) contains newer dependencies including React 19.0.0
- `package 2.json` (backup) contains older dependencies including React 18.2.0
- `middleware.ts` (current) includes Next.js 15 compatibility updates
- `middleware 2.ts` (backup) lacks these updates

## Files Removed
The following backup files were removed:

## Result
The project directory now contains only the current files without any backup duplicates, making it cleaner and less confusing to work with.

## Next Steps
Continue using the original files for development. No renaming was necessary as the main files already had the correct naming convention.
