# Backup Files Cleanup Report

## Summary
All backup files (with "2" in their names) have been successfully moved from the root directory to a separate "DELETED-FILES" directory. The original project files remain untouched.

## Details

### Analysis
After examining key files like `package.json`, `middleware.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`, I determined that:
- The files WITHOUT "2" in their names are the current versions (contain newer code, dependencies, etc.)
- The files WITH "2" in their names are older backup versions

For example:
- `package.json` (current): Uses React 19.0.0 and includes turbo mode for dev script
- `package 2.json` (backup): Uses React 18.2.0 and has a simpler dev script
- `middleware.ts` (current): Includes Next.js 15 compatibility updates
- `middleware 2.ts` (backup): Lacks these updates

### Files Moved to DELETED-FILES
A total of 25 backup files were moved:

#### Documentation Files
- PACKAGE-SALES-PERMISSION-README 2.md
- PACKAGE-SALES-PERMISSION-SUMMARY 2.md
- PACKAGE-SALES-PERMISSIONS-FIX-README 2.md
- PAKET-SATISLARI-YETKI-DUZELTME 2.md
- PAKET-SATISLARI-YETKILERI-FINAL-FIX 2.md
- PERMISSION-SYSTEM-COMPLETE-CHECKLIST 2.md
- PERMISSION-SYSTEM-GUIDE-EN 2.md
- PERMISSIONS-UPDATE-README 2.md
- TAHSILAT-YETKILERI-VE-DUZENLEMELER 2.md
- TYPESCRIPT-CLEANUP-README 2.md
- YETKI-SISTEMI-KILAVUZU 2.md

#### Configuration Files
- middleware 2.ts
- next-env.d 2.ts
- package 2.json
- postcss.config 2.js
- tailwind.config 2.js
- tsconfig 2.json

#### Script Files
- fix-deps 2.sh
- quick-fix 2.sh
- remove-pnpm-refs 2.sh
- reset-typescript 2.sh
- restart-typescript 2.sh
- setup-clean 2.sh
- update-all-permissions 2.sh
- update-package-permissions 2.sh
- update-schema 2.sh

## Result
The root directory now contains only the original files, making it cleaner and easier to work with. All backup files have been preserved in the DELETED-FILES directory in case they're needed for reference.

## Next Steps
1. Continue development using the original files
2. If the DELETED-FILES directory is no longer needed after verification, it can be removed
3. Follow the instructions in README_CLAUDE.md to avoid creating backup files in the future
