To apply the schema changes you need to run the following commands in your terminal:

1. First, create a migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_service_price_history
```

This will:
- Generate a migration file based on the changes we made to schema.prisma
- Apply the migration to your development database
- Generate the updated Prisma Client

2. If you're in a production environment, you would run:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

After running the migration, restart your Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The error in your application should now be fixed as we've added the missing `ServicePriceHistory` model that your code is trying to use.
